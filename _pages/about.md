  <div class="about-content">

    <p>My name is Graeme Elliott, and I am an accomplished APAC & EMEA Team Lead in Brand Protection with more than ten years’ success in helping companies define and design value driven solutions that assist in achieving overall strategic business growth. I have strong analytical and communication skills coupled with the ability to multi-task, work independently, and thrive in a fast-paced, start-up environment.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I have been developing and implementing successful global brand protection programs for clients to help protect their brands’ value. I have also shown my ability to develop deep and enduring relationships with clients, where I have maintained existing services as well as seek new opportunities for expansion.</p>

    <p>As a proactive leader, my style of working is a collaborative type; I excel at providing a detailed analysis and commentary of various infringement issues so that together with clients, we can choose and implement the most practical and efficient enforcement strategies.</p>

    <p>In making use of multiple technologies to identify, examine, and eliminate infringing content for brands, I help protect the brands’ value by creating and implementing a successful brand protection strategy. I have also produced investigative reports into brand protection issues such as the sale of counterfeit goods, websites phishing for customer details, unauthorised use of branding and sale of goods, and internet piracy. My research findings have been distributed to company executives and shareholders as well as published in the media.</p>

    <p>In my spare time I am budding Web Developer, spending my time learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript through the use of online resources and textbooks. This has enabled me to gain an in-depth understanding of how websites are structured, which is a great interest of mine. I am also able to be creative in building beautiful and responsive websites. Whilst most of my projects are predominantly front-end, I have also been learning back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express.js.</p>
